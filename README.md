## DevOps Project for Beginners   

Prerequisite:
AWS Account

Github Account

DockerHub Account

Amazon Linux 2 Instance :-

Before we dive into building our CI/CD pipeline, let's ensure we have a running Amazon Linux 2 - 3 instances with all traffic enabled. This instances will serve as our playground for learning and experimenting with the DevOps tools.

Sign in to the AWS Management Console: Go to AWS Console and sign in to your AWS account.

In the AWS Management Console, navigate to the EC2 service.

Launch an Instance:

Click on the "Instances" link on the left-hand side. Click the "Launch Instance" button.
Choose an Amazon Machine Image (AMI):

In the "Choose an Amazon Machine Image (AMI)" step, select "Amazon Linux 2 AMI."
Choose an Instance Type:

In the "Choose an Instance Type" step, select an instance type based on your requirements. The default t2.micro instance is eligible for the AWS Free Tier.
Configure Instance:

In the "Configure Instance" step, leave the default settings or configure the instance details as needed.
Add Storage:

In the "Add Storage" step, configure the storage settings as needed.
Add Tags:

In the "Add Tags" step, add any tags if required (optional).
Configure Security Group:

In the "Configure Security Group" step, create a new security group or choose an existing one.

For learning purposes, you can create a new security group allowing all traffic. To do this, add a rule with "Type" set to "All traffic" and "Source" set to "Anywhere" (0.0.0.0/0).

Left hand side enter the number of instances as and click on Launch Instances.

Rename Instances:

Instance 1 = Jenkins_Server

Instance 2 = Ansible_Server

Instance 3 = Kubernetes_Server

Now, your Amazon Linux 2 - 3 instances are being launched with all traffic allowed. Once it's running, you can connect to it using SSH with the private key you downloaded.

Remember that keeping all traffic open is not recommended for production environments. For production, you would typically want to restrict access to specific ports based on your application's needs.

Step 1 : Setting up the Jenkins_Server
1) Installing JDK and Jenkins Integration Tool:

As a root use command:

#REPOSITORY REDHAT PACKAGES FOR JENKINS
sudo wget -O /etc/yum.repos.d/jenkins.repo https://pkg.jenkins.io/redhat-stable/jenkins.repo
sudo rpm --import https://pkg.jenkins.io/redhat-stable/jenkins.io-2023.key

#You can install java 11 using 
sudo amazon-linux-extras install java-openjdk11

#You can install using
yum install jenkins

# You can enable the Jenkins service to start at boot with the command:
systemctl enable jenkins

# You can start the Jenkins service with the command:
systemctl start jenkins

# You can check the status of the Jenkins service using the command:
systemctl status jenkins
Install Maven :
The steps to install Apache Maven on your Amazon Linux 2 instance:

#Switch to /opt directory
cd /opt

#Download the maven binaries from official maven site (you can download latest whichever available)
wget https://dlcdn.apache.org/maven/maven-3/3.9.5/binaries/apache-maven-3.9.5-bin.tar.gz

#Extract the downoladed binaries
tar -xvzf apache-maven-3.9.5-bin.tar.gz
3) Install Git :

  #Installing the git
  sudo yum install git
4) Configure Java and Maven Environment Variables:

Let's set up the environment variables for Java and Maven. These variables ensure that our CI/CD pipeline can smoothly build and deploy Java applications.

We need to set the environment variables inside the ~/.bashrc file.

JAVA_HOME for Java and M2, M2_HOME for Maven

#Open the .bashrc file with the VI editor
vi ~/.bashrc
You can find the Java path using the "whereis java" command and copy-paste it in .bashrc :

JAVA_HOME='/usr/lib/jvm/<your java path>'

M2_HOME='/opt/maven'

M2='/opt/maven/bin'

PATH=$JAVA_HOME/bin:$PATH:$M2_HOME:$M2

export PATH

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1699755028550/25ce9d00-fb61-445f-b8b8-3a097cefbf94.png align="center")

Now execute the .bashrc file so that its get's executed and path's get loaded.

#Executee the modified .bashrc file
source ~/.bashrc

#Check paths are visible on the $PATH variable
echo $PATH
With Maven installed and environment variables set, you've now set up Jenkins, JDK, and Maven on your Amazon Linux 2 instance. These tools are essential components for building and automating your Java applications in a CI/CD pipeline.

5) Access Jenkins Web Interface and Install Plugins

Access Jenkins Web Interface: Open a web browser and navigate to http://your_server_ip:8080

Enter Initial Administrator Password:

Retrieve the initial administrator password:

sudo cat /var/lib/jenkins/secrets/initialAdminPassword
Copy the password from the terminal and paste it into the Jenkins web interface.

Complete Jenkins Setup: Follow the on-screen instructions to complete the Jenkins setup, including installing suggested plugins.

Create Jenkins Admin User: Create an admin user with the required credentials.

Now, Jenkins is ready for action! You've successfully configured Jenkins on your server, and it's set up with the necessary plugins for your CI/CD workflow.

6) Configure Tools in Jenkins

Navigate to "Manage Jenkins":

Click on "Manage Jenkins" in the left-hand sidebar.
Configure JDK:

Click on "Global Tool Configuration."

Find the "JDK" section and click "JDK installations"

Click "Add JDK" and provide a name.

Specify the path to your JDK installation in the "JAVA_HOME" field.

Configure Maven:

Find the "Maven" section and click "Maven installations"

Click "Add Maven" and provide a name.

Specify the path to your Maven installation in the "MAVEN_HOME" field.

Configure Git:

Find the "Git" section.

Click "Git installations"

Click "Add Git" and provide a name.

Specify the path to your Git executable in the "Path to Git executable" field.

Click "Save."

Step 2 : Setting up the Ansible_Server
1) Install Ansible:

          #Install ansible 
          sudo amazon-linux-extras install ansible2 -y
2) Create and configure ansible user:

Create user "ansadmin". To add the ansadmin user to the sudoers file (typically managed by the visudo command) to grant them sudo privileges, you can follow these steps:

#Command to open the sudoers file
sudo visudo

#Add the below line to the opened file
ansadmin ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL
![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1699800381798/bfa05f97-03fa-4416-8c36-8c95f80be31e.png align="center")

Next uncomment the PasswordAuthentication yes line in the /etc/ssh/sshd_config file and comment the PasswordAuthentication no line:

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1699800571073/4baae2e5-f4c3-4b0e-9894-2453587a51c5.png align="center")

After making changes to the SSH configuration file, it's a good practice to reload the SSH daemon to apply the changes. Here's the command to do that:

#Command to reload the sshd service
sudo systemctl restart sshd.service
3) Generating and copying the ssh keys:

Generate ssh keys for ansible as well as kubernetes server using the command:

#Command to generate the ssh keys
ssh-keygen
Use the ssh-copy-id command to copy your public key to the ansadmin as well as kubernetes_server root user's authorized_keys file on the remote server:

#Command to copy public key to ansible server ansadmin
ssh-copy-id <your-ansible-server-ip>

#Command to copy public key to kubernetes_server root user
ssh-copy-id root@<your-kubernetes-server-ip>
Configuring the ansible inventory/hosts file:

Open the ansible inventory file which is present at /etc/ansible/hosts location:

#Opening the inventory file for editing
sudo vi /etc/ansible/hosts
Add the ansible_server IP to the above hosts file under the group(anygroup you can create) here [ansible] and [kuberentes] is group and down are the servers IP :

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1699812430034/2d14fa77-c5da-4a6b-ad76-ff882d85ff8f.png align="center")

4) Install Docker :

To install Docker on your system, you can use the following command.

#Command to install docker
sudo yum install docker
After installing Docker, you need to enable and start the Docker service. On Linux systems that use systemd (like Amazon Linux 2), you can use the following commands:

#Command to enable the docker service
sudo systemctl enable docker

#Command to start the docker service
sudo systemctl start docker

#Command to check status of the docker service
sudo systemctl status docker
Now we need to add the ansadmin user to the docker group, allowing them to run Docker commands without using sudo, you can use the following command:

#Command to add the ansadmin to the docker group
sudo usermod -aG docker ansadmin
Now create the working directory in /opt/ directory with docker as name(it can have any name here I used docker) for keeping the playbooks and docker files with ansadmin permissions:

#Changing the group and user permissions for docker file
sudo chgrp ansadmin:ansadmin docker
5) Creating Dockerfile:

Go inside the /opt/docker directory and create the Dockerfile.

cd /opt/docker/
vi Dockerfile
Copy the below code into your created Dockerfile.

FROM tomcat:latest
RUN cp -R  /usr/local/tomcat/webapps.dist/*  /usr/local/tomcat/webapps
COPY ./*.war /usr/local/tomcat/webapps
Dockerfile : builds the tomcat image and copies the webapps.dist files and directories to webapps to run the tomcat default files. Then copy command is used to copy the .war file from current location to containers specified location.

6) Creating playbook to build and push image:

Create a playbook to build the image from the Dockerfile and push that image to the dockerhub.

Here I will create a playbook named build_push_img.yml in the /opt/docker/ directory.

vi build_push_img.yml
Copy the below code to the opened build_push_img.yml

---
- hosts: ansible
  
  tasks:
    - name: create docker image
      command: docker build -t regapp:latest .
      args: 
       chdir: /opt/docker

    - name: Create tag to push image to docekrhub
      command: docker tag regapp:latest shubzz/java_app_img:latest

    - name: Push the image to dockerhub
      command: docker push shubzz/java_app_img:latest
Ansible file explanation:

ansible = group specified in inventory file

command : docker build -t regapp:latest .

command to build image from current directory Dockerfile with regapp:latest tag.

command: docker tag regapp:latest shubzz/java_app_img:latest Command to tag the image here shubzz is my dockerhub username , java_app_img is my dockerhub repository and latest is the tag.

command: docker push shubzz/java_app_img:latest

command to push the docker image to the dockerhub repository .

7) Configuring the Ansible server details in the Jenkins "Configure System":

Firstly install the "Publish over ssh" plugin from "Manage Jenkins" -> Plugins -> Available Plugins -> Search and install "Publish over ssh"

Navigate to "Manage Jenkins" > "Configure System":

Click on "Manage Jenkins" in the left-hand sidebar.

Scroll down and click on "Configure System."

Find the "Publish over ssh" Section

Enter Ansible Server Details:

Enter the following details:

Name: A logical name for your Ansible configuration (e.g., "MyAnsibleServer").

Hostname: The private IP address or hostname of your Ansible server.

Username: The username to use for connecting to the Ansible server in our case it's ansadmin.

Select "Use password authentication, or use a different key" from Advanced Section:

Enter ansadmin user password in Password section.
Save Changes and Test Connection

Step 3 : Setting up the Jenkins_Server
1) Install AWS CLI:

Follow the below commands to install the AWS CLI:

#Download the AWSCLI package from the official aws site
curl "https://awscli.amazonaws.com/awscli-exe-linux-aarch64.zip" -o "awscliv2.zip"

#Unzip the downloaded package
unzip awscliv2.zip

#Install the cli 
sudo ./aws/install
2) Install kubectl

Follow the below commands for kubectl installation:

#Download the KUBECTL package from the official aws site
curl -O https://s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/amazon-eks/1.27.7/2023-11-02/bin/linux/amd64/kubectl

# Make the kubectl binary executable
chmod +x kubectl

# Move the binary to a directory in your PATH
sudo mv kubectl /usr/local/bin/

#Verify the installation
kubectl --version
3) Install eksctl:

Follow the below commands for eksctl installation:

# for ARM systems, set ARCH to: `arm64`, `armv6` or `armv7`
ARCH=amd64
PLATFORM=$(uname -s)_$ARCH

#Download the EKSCTL package from the official aws site
curl -sLO "https://github.com/eksctl-io/eksctl/releases/latest/download/eksctl_$PLATFORM.tar.gz"

#Extract eksctl package and copy to /tmp and remove tar file
tar -xzf eksctl_$PLATFORM.tar.gz -C /tmp && rm eksctl_$PLATFORM.tar.gz

# Move the eksctl binary to a directory in your PATH from tmp
sudo mv /tmp/eksctl /usr/local/bin

# Verify the installation
eksctl version
Resolving kubectl and Kubernetes cluster version mismatches is a common challenge. Ensure compatibility by updating kubectl to match the cluster version using kubectl version --client, preventing issues and enhancing management efficiency

4) Create an IAM Role with AdministratorAccess:

Open the AWS Management Console and navigate to the IAM service.

In the left navigation pane, click on "Roles" and then "Create role."

Choose "AWS service" as the trusted entity type, select "EC2" from the use case options, and click "Next: Permissions."
